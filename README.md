# DynoGamer Bot

## Concept
**DynoGamer Bot** is a simple `.exe` tool that plays the [Google Dinosaur Game](https://elgoog.im/dinosaur-game/) for you.  
It detects obstacles in real-time and automatically makes the dinosaur jump to avoid them — until it eventually fails.

>  **Start the game manually by pressing `SPACE`. The bot takes over from there.**

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- To **quit the bot**, press the **`q` key** or simply close the application window.
- ⚠️ **Leaving it running will continuously press `SPACE`**, which may interfere with other activities.

## How to Use

1. Open the [Dino game](https://elgoog.im/dinosaur-game/) in your browser.
2. Launch the `Dyno_Gamer_Bot.exe` file.
3. Press `SPACE` to start the game.
4. Sit back and watch the bot play!

## Features

- Obstacle detection using pixel analysis with `mss` and `numpy`
